# Overview
https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-ci/latest/[CloudBees CI^] offers a modern continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) 
solution based on Jenkins. Available on AWS, CloudBees CI can run and scale on Kubernetes platforms, like https://aws.amazon.com/eks/[Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service^] (Amazon EKS). CloudBees CI includes Operations Center, which enables administrators to quickly provision Managed Controllers for each development team. Each Managed Controller has the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Kubernetes+Plugin[Kubernetes plugin^] pre-installed, so it can use Kubernetes to launch agent pods that run CI/CD workloads.

This Quick Start provides a turnkey installation of CloudBees CI on Amazon EKS and demonstrates architectural best practices like automatic scaling, segregation of agent workloads, and more. The deployment divides the Amazon EKS cluster into two partitions:

- The first partition runs Operations Center and Managed Controllers on EC2 on-demand instances.
- The second partition runs regular agents on EC2 on-demand instances.

Each partition resides in its own https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/[Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling^] group to scale independently of 
other partitions.

> **Note**
> For advanced use cases with the intent on testing spiky workloads, a third partition can be provisioned to run Spot agents on EC2 Spot instances. The Spot partition uses an https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-ec2-auto-scaling-groups-with-multiple-instance-types-purchase-options/[Auto Scaling group with multiple instance types^] to support a more diversified Spot fleet, which increases Spot Instance availability and uptime. Although Spot Instance requests are not guaranteed and in-use Spot Instances may be reclaimed abruptly, running certain CI/CD workloads on Spot Instances can save up to 50–90 percent on compute costs.

> **Note**
> This reference deployment uses the https://aws-quickstart.github.io/quickstart-amazon-eks/#_overview[Amazon EKS Partner Solution^] as a foundation to provide a fully managed, highly available, and certified Kubernetes-conformant control plane for CloudBees CI.

(APN) Partner that collaborated with AWS on the content of the Partner Solution.

## CloudBees CI on AWS
After you deploy this Quick Start, you can integrate CloudBees CI more deeply with AWS by 
using plugins. For more information, search for AWS and Amazon in the https://plugins.jenkins.io/[Jenkins Plugins Index^]. For CloudBees CI examples, refer to the ***Getting started with CloudBees CI*** section in this guide.

## Cost and licenses
You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this Partner Solution reference deployment. There is no additional cost for using the Partner Solution.
The AWS CloudFormation template for this Partner Solution includes customizable configuration parameters. Some of these settings, such as instance type, affect the cost of deployment. For cost estimates, see the pricing pages for each AWS service you use. Prices are subject to change.

> **Note**
> Tip: After you deploy the Partner Solution, enable the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-reports-gettingstarted-turnonreports.html[AWS Cost and Usage Report^] to track costs associated with the Quick Start. This report delivers billing metrics to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket in your account and provides cost estimates based on usage throughout each month and finalizes the data at the end of the month. For more information, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-reports-costusage.html[AWS documentation^].

After you deploy the Partner Solution, you can request a free, 15-day trial license for CloudBees by choosing Request a trial license in the CloudBees CI Cloud Operations Center.
